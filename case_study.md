# Telling story

## Abstract

This Thursday, RÃ©mi started the day with a bowl of cereals, whole wheat biscuits that he sprinkled with soy milk. He also drinks a glass of citrus juice. After this quick breakfast, he takes the bus to school. He sits all day long, relatively static. At noon, he heads to his favourite cafeteria and eats a salad of various raw vegetables and drizzles them with a little sauce. When he returns home at the end of the day, he gives in to the temptation of chocolate and eats a few squares. The evening meal will be made up of polenta accompanied by a recipe of beans, carrots and tomatoes. Before going to bed, he will still eat a plain yogurt.
