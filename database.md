# Open Food Facts Database

We will use the database from <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> that is a collaborative database. Users take a picture of a food product and the list of ingredients and provide useful information. The database contains more than 708â€™000 product at this day.

The database is not complete. Every products do not have full information because the user may not take a picture of the list of ingredients or the information for a particular product do not exist (not public, differents laws). The terms of use say clearly that their database may contain errors, as the data is manually entered, often partially. Therefore, the data provided can only be used for informative information and not for medical purpose.
