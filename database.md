# Open Food Facts Database <image src="./image/OpenFoodFacts_logo.png" style="width:100px;height:100px;"></image>


We will mainly use the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> database, which is a collaborative open-access database. Users can contribute by taking a picture of any food product, the list of nutrients and thus provide useful information. The database contains more than 708â€™000 products at this day and this number is growing rapidly.

This collaborative database system makes it possible to quickly gather a huge amount of information. However, this also has other advantages. User entries can be incorrect, inaccurate or simply incomplete. Therefore, the database is far from being complete. Many products do not have full information because the user may not take a picture of the list of ingredients or sometimes also because the information for a particular product is missing on the packing (not public, differents laws, etc.). The OpenFoodFacts terms of use clearly state that the database may contain errors. As a consequence, the data provided can only be used for informative information and not for medical purpose.
