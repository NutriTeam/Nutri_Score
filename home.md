# Welcome dear visitor
Have you ever wondered how to eat better without (too much) changing? How to find the best product right away, without wasting hours deciphering labels? You have come to the right place. __Extending NutriScore__ project opens new perspectives for dietetics and healthier eating. This data story will present you everything you need to know about our application. 

## Introduction
The nutrition is a major issue in the Western civilization. The bad eating habits are becoming one of the main causes of illness in the world, with very heavy impact on public health. Recently, the various products are being graded through nutrition benefits indices, as for example NutriScore. NutriScore can give an accurate estimation on how healthy an ingredient can be. However, if it can make sense at the ingredient scale, the concept of Nutri-Score would be way more valuable if it were computed considering wider time spans instead of individual ingredients. Indeed, in its present version, NutriScore would always give a very high grade to white rice, for example. However, if you only eat white rice, your overall nutrition will not be optimal. The present computation of Nutri-Score is strongly limited, as it is unable to contextualize the consumption of a certain product in regard with the daily feeding practises. It is clear that consumers would greatly benefit from personalized advice on their diet on a daily basis. Our project is not just about reporting back to users. It also allows them to quickly identify healthier foods on the market, while taking into account their food cravings.

## Goals
* Establish a global nutritional evaluation across a short to middle period of time (days to weeks)
* Warn about nutritional deficiencies, excesses and lack of diversity
* Propose an alternative that corresponds to the user's food cravings and deliver advices on a healthier diet
