# Abstract
The nutrition is a major issue in the Western civilization. The bad eating habits are becoming one of the main causes of illness in the world, with very heavy impact on public health. Recently, the various products are being graded through nutrition benefits indices, as for example Nutri-Score. 
Nutri-Score can give an accurate estimation on how healthy an ingredient can be. However, if it can make sense at the ingredient scale, the concept of Nutri-Score would be way more valuable if it were computed considering wider time spans instead of individual ingredients. Indeed, in its present version, Nutri-Score would always give a very high grade to white rice, for example. However, if you only eat white rice, your overall nutrition will not be optimal. The present computation of Nutri-Score is strongly limited, as it is unable to contextualize the consumption of a certain product in regard with the daily feeding practises.

# Research questions
* Global nutritional evaluation across a short to middle period of time (days to weeks) instead of an ingredient focused approach
* List the consumption of additives with a short description and an health evaluation
* Warning about nutritional deficiencies, excesses and lack of diversity
* Proposition of healthier ingredients choices to improve the eating habits, based on the previous evaluations
